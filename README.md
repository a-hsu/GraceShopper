# Grayce Shoppa

## Description

Grayce Shoppa is an ecommerce platform designed and developed during my time at Full Stack Academy. During the span of about two weeks, my group developed a basic platform that to allow users to log in, add products to their persisting carts, and make a purchase.

Role: Programmer
    - I was in charge of developing the Single Product page, developing our backend

Tech Stack: Javascript, React, Redux, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Express, HTML, CSS
## Setup

Clone the repo into your directory using `git clone`. Then, within the directory, install the proper node modules:

`npm install`
## Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

-   start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
-   start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
-   start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
